originalQuestion:Explain how animal agriculture and dairy lead to climate crisis and increased GHG emissions?
query:What are the major greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by animal agriculture and dairy production?
answer:The provided context states that eliminating meat and dairy production would eliminate about 3/4ths of all emissions from agriculture and other land use. However, it does not specify which greenhouse gases are emitted by animal agriculture and dairy production. Therefore, I cannot answer your question.

originalQuestion:Explain how animal agriculture and dairy lead to climate crisis and increased GHG emissions?
query:How does deforestation for grazing land and feed production contribute to climate change?
answer:Deforestation for grazing land and feed production contributes to climate change because livestock occupy a large percentage of ice-free land and consume feed from land used for crops. This demand drives deforestation and land degradation. Eliminating livestock production could significantly reduce emissions from agriculture and land use.

originalQuestion:Explain how animal agriculture and dairy lead to climate crisis and increased GHG emissions?
query:What is the impact of enteric fermentation in livestock on GHG emissions?
answer:Methane emissions, a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, come from livestock. Enteric fermentation in livestock contributes to these methane emissions. In 2019, methane accounted for 18% of global human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.

originalQuestion:Explain how animal agriculture and dairy lead to climate crisis and increased GHG emissions?
query:What is the impact of methane emissions from livestock on global warming?
answer:Methane emissions, including those from livestock, contribute to global warming. In 2019, methane accounted for 18% of global human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions come from various sources, including livestock, manure, and other agricultural and industrial activities.
