This demand drives deforestation and land degradation. Eliminating livestock production could significantly reduce emissions from agriculture and land use.\n"}

How does it increase the GHG Emissions?","query":"What is the contribution of animal agriculture to greenhouse gas emissions?","answer":"Eliminating livestock production for meat and dairy could eliminate about 3/4ths of all emissions from agriculture and other land use. Livestock also occupy 37% of ice-free land area on Earth and consume feed from 12% of land area used for crops. This contributes to deforestation and land degradation.\n"}

Livestock also occupy a large percentage of ice-free land and consume feed from land used for crops, leading to deforestation and land degradation. Shifting people towards plant-based diets is a key component of reducing emissions.\n"}

How does it increase the GHG Emissions?","query":"What are the specific greenhouse gases emitted by animal agriculture and dairy industries?","answer":"Animal agriculture and dairy industries primarily emit methane. They also contribute to nitrous oxide emissions through manure. The specific amounts of each gas emitted by these industries are not specified in the context.\n"}

Marginalized people with less control over resources face difficulties in mitigating and recovering from climate shocks. Wealthier populations also contribute more to global emissions, with the wealthiest 10% responsible for 50% of emissions.\n"}

The wealthiest 10% are responsible for 50% of global emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for only 8%. Climate justice advocates argue that those most responsible for climate change should bear the costs of adaptation, particularly in poorer countries.\n"}

In contrast, the bottom 50% are responsible for only 8%. This disparity highlights the disproportionate impact of high consumption lifestyles on greenhouse gas emissions.\n"}

However, the wealthiest 10% of people were responsible for 50% of global emissions in 2023. CO2 emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport, manufacturing, heating, and electricity.\n"}

Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas for energy production, transportation, and industrial processes releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2). Deforestation reduces the planet's capacity to absorb CO2, while agricultural practices, particularly livestock farming and fertilizer use, contribute to emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), respectively. These greenhouse gases trap heat and lead to a gradual warming of the planet, resulting in climate change and its associated effects.","RESPONSE":"The primary cause of climate change is human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution. This releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which trap heat in the lower atmosphere. The concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by about 50% since the pre-industrial era.\n"}
